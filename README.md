 Air Quality Forecasting (Beijing PM2.5 Prediction)


This repository contains my work for the **Machine Learning Techniques I course assignment on air quality forecasting. The task is to predict PM2.5 concentrations** in Beijing using deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN-LSTM).



Project Overview
- Preprocessed historical weather and pollution data.
- Handled missing values using time interpolation.
- Transformed data into sliding window sequences.
- Implemented LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM models.
- Conducted 16 hyperparameter experiments.
- Evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Submitted predictions to Kaggle.
